#Step 1: A single-turn LLM call.

#Send ONE message, print ONE reply. This is the seed the whole chatbot grows from:
#notice that `messages` is a LIST, even though it has only one item right now.

#Setup: pip install groq python-dotenv   (+ GROQ_API_KEY in .env from console.groq.com/keys)
#Run:   python single_turn.py
