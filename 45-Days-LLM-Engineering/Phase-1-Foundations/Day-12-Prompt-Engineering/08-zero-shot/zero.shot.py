Zero-shot prompting -- ask directly, with NO examples.

"Zero-shot" = you give instructions only and trust the model to figure it out.
It works well when the task is common and your instructions are CRISP:
say exactly what to do, the allowed outputs, and the format.

Setup: pip install groq python-dotenv  (+ GROQ_API_KEY in .env)
