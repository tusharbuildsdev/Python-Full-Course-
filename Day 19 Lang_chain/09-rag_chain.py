03 - The RAG chain: retrieval + LCEL = grounded answers.

This is the payoff of the last two modules. RAG is NOT a new framework -- it's
yesterday's prompt | model | parser chain with a RETRIEVER bolted on the front:

    {"context": retriever | format_docs, "question": passthrough}
        | prompt | model | parser

Read it: fetch the relevant chunks -> stitch them into a context string -> drop
that (plus the question) into a prompt -> model answers ONLY from that context
-> parse to plain text. Every arrow is the same LCEL | from Day 21.

Retrieval runs locally (no key). The final model call needs GROQ_API_KEY; without
one we still BUILD the chain and show the retrieved context, then skip the call.

Setup:
    pip install langchain langchain-groq langchain-chroma langchain-huggingface python-dotenv
Run:
    python rag_chain.py

# the model is told to stick to retrieved facts and admit when it can't.

# The dict runs BOTH branches for each input:
#   context  = retriever(question) -> format_docs   (fetch + stitch)
#   question = the input, unchanged (RunnablePassthrough)
# Their outputs fill {context} and {question} in the prompt. Then model, parse.
