"""
01 - Documents & splitters: the LangChain way to chunk text.

RAG step 1 is always the same: break big text into small, searchable CHUNKS.
Day 20 wrote a word-counter chunker by hand. LangChain gives you a smarter one
that respects the SHAPE of the text (paragraphs -> sentences -> words) so a
chunk rarely gets cut mid-sentence.

Two objects to meet:
    Document  -- LangChain's wrapper: .page_content (the text) + .metadata (a dict)
    RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter -- splits text/Documents into chunks with overlap

No API key needed -- splitting is pure text work.

Setup:
    pip install langchain-text-splitters langchain-core
Run:
    python splitters.py

# --- 1. The splitter ------------------------------------------------------
# chunk_size    = target max characters per chunk.
# chunk_overlap = characters repeated between neighbours, so a fact split
#                 across a boundary still appears whole in at least one chunk.
# "Recursive" = it tries to split on big separators first (\n\n paragraphs),
# then smaller ones (\n, ". ", " "), only cutting mid-word as a last resort.

# --- 3. The same thing, but as Document objects ---------------------------
# In RAG you usually carry METADATA (where did this text come from?) so you can
# cite sources later. create_documents makes a Document per chunk; you can
# attach metadata that every chunk inherits.

# You can also build Documents by hand -- handy when each source is separate.
