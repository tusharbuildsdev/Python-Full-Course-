06 - Conversation memory the LangChain way (current, non-deprecated).

On Day 16 we gave a chatbot memory by keeping a `messages` list and appending
every turn. LangChain's modern building block for that is MessagesPlaceholder:
a slot in your prompt that holds all past turns. You keep a small history list
and pass it in each call - the model then sees the whole conversation.

(Older tutorials use RunnableWithMessageHistory; it's now DEPRECATED in favour
of LangGraph's persistence. For a simple chat, the pattern below is the clean,
supported approach - and it's exactly what LangGraph automates later.)

The offline demo uses a FAKE model (a plain function) so you can watch history
grow with no key. The live demo uses Groq to really remember your name.

Setup:
    pip install langchain langchain-groq python-dotenv
Run:
    python conversation_memory.py
