03 - Conditional edges: let the graph CHOOSE the next node.

A normal edge is fixed:  add_edge("a", "b")  always goes a -> b.
A CONDITIONAL edge runs a little "router" function that looks at the state and
RETURNS THE NAME of where to go next. This is the branching a | chain can't do.

    add_conditional_edges("classify", route, {"billing": "billing", ...})
                           ^source     ^router  ^map: router's return -> node

We build a support-desk router: classify a message, then branch to the matching
handler node. Pure Python (rule-based) so it runs with no API key -- the point
is the GRAPH SHAPE, not the classifier. (A real app would classify with a model.)

Setup:
    pip install langgraph
Run:
    python conditional_edges.py
